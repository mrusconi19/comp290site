In this GRQ you will use `git` to create a new repository and GitHub to host it. Additionally, you will use GitHub pages to setup a simple web page for the project. In the process of working through this GRQ, you will gain practice working with `git`, commits, remotes, and branches.

This project is for the COMP290 tools course to practice `git`
